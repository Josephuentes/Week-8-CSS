   <p>When you start the game you cannot bring up a map in game. You are only given locations where you can extract from the raid with the loot and gear you find.</p>
   <p>There maps that other people have made that shows the map layout and where the extracts are.</p>
   <p>While traversing the map you need to keep an eye out for landmarks that you would see on the map.</p>

   <p>This is the Customs map. The traders in Tarkov give you tasks to complete in the Customs Map as you progress through the tasks.</p>
   <p>The trader Prapor wants you to find his friend's bronze pocket watch in Customs. This is one task that requires you to go onto Customs.</p>
   <p>As of now there are 8 traders in the game that give you tasks and trade different supplies.</p>
