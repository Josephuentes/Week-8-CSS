        <p>Bullets have a a damage value when hitting body parts, as well as a penetration value when hitting armor.</p>
        <p>Here is a more detailed explanation all the calibers and there damage/penetration values in Escape from Tarkov. <a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistics">Ballistics</a></p>
        <p>The 9x19 mm caliber has the PsT gzh bullet. This bullet has high damage, but poor armor penetration.</p>
        <p>The PBP gzh bullet, however, has higher armor penetration and is better at damaging high armored targets.</p>

        <p>The armor someone is wearing determines if the bullet will penetrate the armor or not.</p>
        <p>Armor ranges from Class 1 Armor and up to Class 6 Armor.</p> 
        <p>PsT gzh round has a hard time penetrating Class 4 and above, whereas PBP can damage the armor and penetrate it.</p>

        <p>Depending the helmet and armor someone is wearing, you'd have to assess what bullet your using and where to shoot them.</p>
        <p>Arms and legs are the most exposed body part when someone has armor on.</p>
        <p>If you are using high damage, low armor penetration you would aim for the legs </p>
